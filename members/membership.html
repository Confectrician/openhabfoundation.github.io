		<p>The current smarthome market suffers under the commercial interests and competition of big companies, which are fighting for customers and try to force their proprietary ecosystems. This leads to a highly fragmented market with vendor lock-ins, making participation and contribution of the public a true challenge with barriers.</p>
		
		<p>We highly believe that smart homes must not be closed or restricted, but that everybody must have the freedom to participate, modify and enhance it.</p>

		<p>The openHAB Foundation e.V. was founded to boost innovation and to make smart home technology available for everybody by empowering individuals and organizations.</p>
		<p>The Foundation is the central place for supporters which want to spread the word about openHAB and want to help becoming it a respected alternative to commercial solutions.</p>
